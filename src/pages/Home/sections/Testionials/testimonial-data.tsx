          Pete is a rock solid one-man-army that led multiple major website
          overhauls and evolutions for us at Brandwatch. A strong collaborator,
          with a fine balance of design and tech, Pete’s work ethic was epic and
          his commitment to quality was honestly inspiring. I’d work with Pete
          again in a heartbeat.

          Pete is exceptional, a rare engineering talent combining a keen eye
          for design with a logical, systems driven approach to scalable
          front-end code and immaculate taste. Pete can take a project from
          ideation, through to concept, prototype, iteration and deployable,
          production ready front-end code all as one single unit.
        </p>

          Pete operates at a level of perfection and quality that is best in
          class, expertise of this type in a single discipline is rare to find
          but Pete can achieve this across the stack. If you want to work with
          the best then you wont find better.

          Pete was initially hired in as someone to take the lead in the
          business on UX. The first task was joining the product design team to
          help craft our next generation set of tools. It’s fair to say Pete was
          an instant star in the business and really wowed everyone with his
          combination of speed and quality. Not only that Pete turned out to be
          the equal of our best developers from the start, and played an active
          role in not only designing the UX but delivering really great code to
          implement it. During the whole course of Pete’s time with us, his
          involvement in the business became stronger. Without a doubt with his
          eye for quality design, passion for great architecture and pure coding
          ability, one of the most valuable team members you could hope to work
          with.

          Pete worked for me specialising in design and front end technology.
          Redesigning a desktop app and designing a mobile app for a client
          showed that Pete has the rare qualities of design and engineering in
          one person. Pete is very quick to pick up and run with technical
          concepts and is super organised. His designs always please and hit the
          spot and show a thorough appreciation of user centred design. Also he
          is highly personable, polite and dedicated to his roles, we have
          worked and continue to work together on many projects since Pete went
          on to greater things.

          I worked with Pete for 4 years at Brandwatch. We collaborated on some
          huge projects: Global Conference series digital identity, complete
          rebrand and overhaul of the Brandwatch.com and Buzzsumo sites. Working
          alongside Pete has been phenomenal, his work ethic, his determination
          blended with his skills creates someone who people want to work with
          as you know what you deliver will always be a level above where you
          even expected it to be in the first place. A true pleasure to work
          with. No doubt our paths will cross in the future.
