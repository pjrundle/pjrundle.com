> **Brandwatch’s global marketing presence operated at significant scale — multiple active websites, thousands of content entries, and continuous publishing across regions and teams. The web platform functioned as a primary acquisition and lead‑generation engine, serving millions of views each year. My role focused on designing and evolving the front‑end systems that enabled this level of output. Over time, this meant owning and extending a centralized design system, content‑builder tooling, and shared architectural foundations that allowed marketing teams to produce and maintain high‑quality digital experiences without engineering bottlenecks.**

## Context

As Brandwatch grew, its marketing operations expanded across products, regions, campaigns, and events. This created a familiar tension: the need for rapid publishing and experimentation, balanced against the need for consistency, performance, and maintainability.

Running multiple independent sites with separate codebases was not viable. The organization needed a system that could support high‑volume production while keeping brand, UX, and engineering aligned.

## Building a System for Marketing at Scale

Early versions of Brandwatch’s front‑end systems were developed collaboratively. Over time, I became responsible for evolving and extending this foundation into a more centralized and scalable platform.

This work focused on:

- Establishing a shared design system used across multiple active sites and brands
- Designing CSS and component architecture optimized for speed, consistency, and long‑term maintainability
- Creating reusable templates and structured layouts to support rapid page creation
- Reducing duplication and fragmentation across marketing properties

The goal was not just visual consistency, but operational scalability.

## Content Builders and Authoring Workflows

A key part of the system was the development and extension of content‑builder tooling that allowed distributed marketing teams to create and manage pages without direct engineering involvement.

These builders:

- Enabled the production of landing pages, guides, reports, webinars, and campaign content
- Standardized layouts and interaction patterns
- Allowed content to remain on‑brand while supporting experimentation
- Reduced reliance on custom, one‑off builds

Over time, the system expanded to support additional outputs, including structured email production and campaign experiences, all built on shared front‑end foundations.

## Operating Across Multiple Sites and Regions

At any given time, the system supported numerous active websites, including the primary brand site, international variants, and campaign microsites.

This required:

- Shared components and templates that could adapt across contexts
- Consistent UX patterns regardless of site or region
- Performance and maintainability at scale

The result was an ecosystem of sites and content that behaved like a single platform rather than disconnected properties.

## High‑Impact Delivery

Alongside system work, I contributed directly to high‑traffic pages and interactive experiences, including:

- Homepages and product pages built on top of shared foundations
- Interactive tools and campaign experiences
- Custom builds that extended the system where needed

These projects balanced bespoke execution with reusable architecture, ensuring the system continued to evolve alongside real delivery needs.

## Conversion & Optimization

Alongside system development and delivery, I worked closely with the CRO function to improve performance across key pages and flows.

This involved:

- Collaborating on new page and component designs
- Designing with testability in mind from the outset
- Supporting and interpreting A/B test results from a UX and interaction perspective
- Proposing new experiments based on observed user behavior

Rather than treating optimization as a separate layer, it became part of the design and delivery process. New patterns were often shaped through experimentation, then folded back into the shared system once validated.

This created a feedback loop where architecture, UX, and performance informed each other continuously.

## Leadership and Collaboration

As the platform matured, I led and mentored a small web team and worked closely with marketing design, content, and leadership.

Partnerships with senior stakeholders — including the CMO, CDO, and Art Director — focused on translating brand direction into durable front-end systems rather than one-off design decisions.

The web team also operated as an open internal partner across the business. Teams could bring workflows, ideas, and friction points directly to us.

For example, the legal team shared their process for publishing web content — a manual workflow that consumed significant time and produced inconsistent results. Working together, we prioritized and systematized this into a structured approach that reduced overhead and aligned output with the broader platform.

This ensured that brand evolution — and operational improvements — could be implemented consistently across all properties.

## Impact

The systems developed during this period allowed Brandwatch’s marketing organization to operate independently of engineering for day-to-day publishing, while maintaining consistency and performance across properties.

Marketing teams could:

- Launch and iterate on pages without custom builds
- Produce large volumes of content within defined system constraints
- Maintain brand and UX consistency across regions and campaigns
- Extend the platform through reusable patterns rather than one-off solutions

Front-end architecture shifted from supporting individual pages to enabling an entire operational model.

## Reflection

This work reinforced the role of front-end systems as organizational infrastructure.

When architecture prioritizes reuse, clarity, and structured authoring, engineering stops being a gatekeeper and becomes an enabler. Marketing, design, and product can operate more autonomously, while still benefiting from shared standards and foundations.

The value was not just in the pages produced, but in the system that made continuous production possible.
