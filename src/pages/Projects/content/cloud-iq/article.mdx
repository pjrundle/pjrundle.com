> **CloudIQ was a B2B SaaS platform operating in a complex ecommerce marketing landscape. I initially joined as a UX consultant to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of a legacy platform, and was later retained as a lead design engineer bridging product discovery, front-end architecture, and delivery. Over time, the role evolved from advisory work into a hands-on position shaping future product direction, prototyping new systems in code, and contributing directly to production features alongside the front-end team.**

## Context

When I joined, the organization was balancing multiple priorities: modernizing a legacy product, exploring new product directions, and supporting marketing and sales workflows.

The initial brief was to assess the then current version of their platform, talk to team members from different areas across the business, and come up with a set of aspirational designs that would inform the next iteration. This quickly expanded into a broader discovery effort spanning product, engineering, sales, account management, and leadership.

## Discovery Across the Organization

Rather than treating UX as a surface-level problem, the work focused on understanding how the product was actually used, where adoption broke down, and how internal teams supported customers.

This involved:

- Working closely with product and engineering to understand technical constraints and roadmap realities
- Partnering with sales and account teams to uncover workflow friction and customer pain points
- Engaging leadership to align on long-term product direction and positioning

The outcome was a clearer picture of how usability, architecture, and organizational processes were interconnected.

## From Consultant to Embedded Design Engineer

As discovery progressed, it became clear that recommendations alone wouldn’t be enough. The work shifted from advisory to hands-on — using code as the primary medium to explore solutions and validate future directions.

This marked a transition into a lead design engineering role, bridging product thinking, UX, and front-end implementation.

## Designing in Code

Instead of static mockups, I translated findings directly into working React and Next.js prototypes. These high-fidelity artifacts allowed teams to experience potential product directions in a realistic way and created a shared reference point across disciplines.

Prototypes explored:

- Interaction patterns for future tools
- System structure and information hierarchy
- New workflows and user journeys
- Architectural approaches for scaling UI

This approach accelerated alignment and reduced the gap between design intent and engineering execution.

## Prototypes as Alignment Tools

A continuously deployed prototype environment became a central part of the workflow. Built with React, Next.js, and realtime data, it allowed ideas to move quickly from concept to something tangible.

These prototypes were used for:

- Internal alignment across product and engineering
- Customer demonstrations and feedback
- Strategic conversations about future product direction

The result was a more collaborative and evidence-driven approach to product decision-making.

## Exploring Complex Workflows

One of the key areas of focus was a visual campaign flow builder prototype – something that the CEO and CTO saw as crucial to the next incarnation of the platform. I developed this inside the React/Next prototype and iterated with the team until it reached a state where integration with existing backend systems became viable. This work tested complex workflows, interaction models, and state management approaches.

It provided a safe environment to explore architectural decisions before committing to production implementation.

## Production Delivery

As the work matured, I joined the senior front-end team as a key contributor, collaborating closely with backend, DevOps, and product.

Responsibilities included:

- Contributing production features
- Aligning UI implementation with emerging system patterns
- Supporting architectural decisions through working code
- Adoption and roll out of React-Query
- Aiding other developers with UX + UI implementation passes

This ensured that insights from discovery and prototyping translated into real product improvements.

## Rebrand and Strategic Support

Alongside product work, I supported a company-wide rebrand — refining agency output and implementing it consistently across the website and product UI. I collaborated closely with Cloud.IQ's sole in-house designer, providing feedback and mentorship.

I also worked closely with the C-suite on product positioning and technical storytelling, including the development of investor-facing materials and demonstrations.

## Impact & Reflection

This work reinforced a core belief: meaningful product progress rarely comes from separating design and engineering. It comes from staying close to implementation, where ideas are tested against real constraints and real delivery.

Working in code — close to real constraints, teams, and architecture — enabled:

- Faster validation of complex ideas
- Stronger alignment between product and engineering
- Earlier testing of architectural decisions
- A direct path from discovery to production delivery
